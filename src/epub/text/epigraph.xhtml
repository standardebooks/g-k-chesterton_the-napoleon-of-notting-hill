				<p>
					<span>For every tiny town or place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God made the stars especially;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Babies look up with owlish face</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And see them tangled in a tree:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You saw a moon from Sussex Downs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A Sussex moon, untravelled still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw a moon that was the town's,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The largest lamp on Campden Hill.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yea; Heaven is everywhere at home</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The big blue cap that always fits,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so it is (be calm; they come</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To goal at last, my wandering wits),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So is it with the heroic thing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This shall not end for the world's end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And though the sullen engines swing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be you not much afraid, my friend.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This did not end by Nelson's urn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where an immortal England sits—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor where your tall young men in turn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Drank death like wine at Austerlitz.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the pedants bade us mark</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What cold mechanic happenings</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Must come; our souls said in the dark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Belike; but there are likelier things."</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Likelier across these flats afar</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These sulky levels smooth and free</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The drums shall crash a waltz of war</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Death shall dance with Liberty;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Likelier the barricades shall blare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Slaughter below and smoke above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And death and hate and hell declare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That men have found a thing to love.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Far from your sunny uplands set</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw the dream; the streets I trod</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lit straight streets shot out and met</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The starry streets that point to God.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This legend of an epic hour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A child I dreamed, and dream it still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under the great grey water-tower</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That strikes the stars on Campden Hill.</span>
